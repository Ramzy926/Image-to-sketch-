# Image to Sketch 🖼️✏️

Convert images into sketch-style art using Python, Pillow, and NumPy.

## 📦 Dependencies
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

Install them with:
```bash
pip install pillow numpy
```

*🚀 How to Use*
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ramzy926/Image-to-sketch-.git
   ```
2. Place your image in the project folder.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python sketch.py
   ```

*🧠 How It Works*
- Loads the image using Pillow.
- Converts it to grayscale.
- Applies a sketch effect using NumPy operations.

*📁 Example*
Input: `photo.jpg`
Output: `sketch_photo.jpg`
